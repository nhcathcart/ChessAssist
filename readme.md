# Chess Assist

Chess assist is a website to help improve your chess game. The site will gather game data from LiChess's API for a given username, and recreate positions to practice from. For example: positions from your games just before you made a mistake, positions just after your opponent made a mistake, or positions before you missed a checkmate sequence. As well as a couple of others. Happy practicing.
